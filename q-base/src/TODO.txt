FOR PAPER

Check that parallel join works
Check that udf_deg2 works 

========================================


openmp
data sharing -- Think about when should things be marked as private
====

f1s1opf2
bug when we are working with hashes

===
app_tbl  -> deal with SC and SV or disallow for now 
===
code review join, especially when src = null and dst = I1
consider separating dld as separate utility, especially for large hash tables
integrate leveldb
text fields as such e.g., email, for both SC and SV
check approximation algorithms and test them 
nn for f1opf2, f1s1opf2, f1f2opf3 should be done properly
==
In f1opf2, you need to check smear, cum, ... for ability to make part of a
compound statement
==
Fix P0 bug in srt_uniform 
add srt_uniform_I8 
------
In f1opf2 and (I think) f1f2opf3, the nn field for f3 is computed
simplistically. In particualr, it is very likely that nn[i] = 0 and f[i] != 0.
If we are going to insist on the conventiont that nn[i] = => f[i]= 0, then
this needs to be fixed.
==
In dld, use dateconv and other direct conversion routines
==
In del_fld, cannot delete fields idx, len, off, txt from a dict_tbl
==
continuous testing
(a) generate dump and then write invariants against those tests
==
stuff to integrate from Kishore
count_vals_maps()
count_vals_ldb()
top_n()

approx_quantile()
approx_freq()
approx_unique()

In test/kj_qldb/, mak Makefiles to create executables for each file
==
sortbindmp
find out why I8:I8 did not produce what I4:I4:I4:I4 did in plp.sh in Funnels
==
Put back import
==
pr_fld => Test SC. 
== 
some of get_meta and set_meta updates TBL_FLD_TYPE. Implement these.
==
Change parsort1 after including Kishore's quantiles
==
Be very careful when importing to deal with importing tables upon which fields
depend
====
Clean up is_a_in_b in terms of using the same file to mean different things
based upon invocation
==
orpahn_files -- needs to account for ddir_id 
==
in srt_join use I8/F8 for sum even when input is I4/F4
because otherwise we might have overflow
==
In mk_temp_file, should be able to default to g_data_dir if temp dir does not
have enough space. 
====
think about setting grain size for cilkfor to avoid false sharing
====
memcpy versus ippsCopy_XX
===========
We should have copy_flds to optimize the following situation.
If we use a condition field, then we need to count the number of rows
We have to do this for *every* call. However, if the same condition field is
being used for all the copy_fld calls, then we need to have done it only for
the first.
===========
To document: No checks being made for conv function
Templatize *ALL* sort functions
Templatize f1f2opf3_arith

Find orphan files

App_tbl: Need to deal with fact that you cannot append to a field if you are
not its owner. 

====================================================================
There is a bug in mjoin that does not provide values to the second occurrence
of a value on the destination side. As an example, notice the last row in the
sample output below

q pr_flds t2 f1:f2:f1reg:f1min:f1max:f1sum:f1and:f1or
"100","10","","","","","",""
"200","20","2","2","2","2","2","2"
"300","30","3","3","3","3","3","3"
"400","40","4","4","4","4","4","4"
"400","50","5","5","5","5","5","5"
"500","60","7","5","7","18","4","7"
"600","60","7","","","","",""
====================================================================
Packaging
To deal with error message: TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [save size=5000].
	o sudo vi /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
	o Replace save_size with a larger value, say 50000 
===================================================
Source code modifications
Following suggestions from http://www.jetcafe.org/jim/c-style.html

For constants, consider using:
enum { Red = 0xF00, Blue = 0x0F0, Green = 0x00F };
static const float pi = 3.14159265358;
instead of #defines, which are rarely visible in debuggers. 

Since macros can be dangerous, follow tradition fully capitalize them,
otherwise following the conventions for function or variable names. 

Use goto sparingly. Two harmless places to use it are to break out of a
multilevel loop, or to jump to common function exit code. (Often these are the
same places.) 

Say:
char *p;
not:
char* p;

for functions. Don't parenthesize things unnecessarily; say
return 7;
not
return (7);
and especially not
return(7);

Rule 5 
Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized
things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data
structures, not algorithms, are central to programming

malloc
Don't cast the return value of calls to malloc, It has type void *, so it
will be compatible with anything. K&R2, p. 142 gives contrary advice, but
it has since been retracted by Dennis Ritchie:
"In any case, now that I reread the stuff on p. 142, I think it's
wrong; it's written in such a way that it's not just defensive
against earlier rules, it misrepresents the ANSI rule"
=======================================================
Set meta-data for sort whenever a field is sorted
sort_type is not always preserved. Some operations (like f1s1opf2) should
preserve it
Check meta-data for sort whenever sort is assumed. Examples are
	is_a_in_b (f2 in t2)
	srt_join (...)
	....
	count_vals
	copy_fld
	dup_fld

====
Some time I need to make sure that IPP does not cause me a problem because it
often assumes number of elements to be an int whereas I assume long long and
this causes problems when size of array exceeds INT_MAX
===
add semaphore to qhttpd server and to q process
