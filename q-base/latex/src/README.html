<h1>qtils</h1>

<p><b>qtils</b> is a collection of data-wrangling utilities. While
Hadoop has
emerged as the de-facto standard for large data analysis tasks, there
are
often a large number of simple data manipulation operations that need to
be performed in interactive mode as a post-processing step. The data for
post-processing is often small enough to fit on a user's desktop.
<b>qtils</b> is collection of efficient utilities for a data
scientist.</p>

<p>In our experience, the life of a data scientist is often less
glamorous
than the public perception. Accelerating the speed of inquiry --- both
in terms of run time and scripting time --- significantly decreases some
of the pains that come with the territory, opening up time to do
higher-level thinking.</p>

<p>While <b>qtils</b> was designed primarily as a useful toolkit for
data
scientists, we believe it can be used in other contexts as well. A case
in point is our paper entitled "In Data Veritas --- Data Driven Testing
for Distributed
Systems", which was presented at DBTest2013, a SIGMOD workshop in New
York in 2013.</p>

<p>We believe by open sourcing, we can both contribute to the community
while benefiting from their feedback and contributions.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<ul>
<li>Copy the file qtils.tgz into a directory and cd to that
directory</li>
<li>tar -zcvf qtils.tgz</li>
<li>cd src </li>
<li>make</li>
<li>You should get a single file called <b>q</b></li>
<li>cd ../test/</li>
<li>You will see a number of examples and unit tests over here. Each
sub-directory has a file called <em>test.sh</em> which can be
executed</li>
</ul>

<h2>You need to set 2 environment variables.</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Q_DOCROOT</b> This is the directory where the meta data will be
stored</li>
<li><b>Q_DATA_DIR</b> This is the directory where the      data will be
stored</li>
</ul>

<h1>Hello World</h1>

<pre><code>mkdir            /tmp/qtils_test
export Q_DOCROOT=/tmp/qtils_test
export Q_DATA_DIR=/tmp/qtils_test
q init # This initializes the meta data
q add_tbl t1 10 # Creates a table with 10 rows
# Create a 4 byte integer field f1 in t1 whose values are 1, 2, ...
q s_to_f t1 f1 'op=[seq]:start=[1]:incr=[1]:fldtype=[I4]'
q list_tbls # list tables
q describe t1    # describes table t1
q describe t1 f1 # describes fld f1 in table t1
q pr_fld t1 f1 # Prints the values of f1 in t1
q fop    t1 f1 sortD # Sorts f1 in t1 in descending order
q pr_fld t1 f1 # Notice that values have switched order
q delete t1    # Clean up
</code></pre>
